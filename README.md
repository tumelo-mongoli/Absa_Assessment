Task 1

> Was completed using postman and I saved the collection in the Task 1 folder. 
> Please import that collection using Postman and it will be executable in Postman 


Task 2 

> This task was completed using a Chrome extension called Katalon Recorder (Selenium tests generator)
> Reason I used Katalon Recorder is because I unfortunately do not possess a machine that can enable me to install an 
open source automation tool due to technical limitations (Many open source tools use 64bit OS and I currently have 32bit OS)
> The process to run the automation test is simply adding the Katalon Recorder as an extension to chrome then import the file 
in the task 2 folder.
